# List of component for harvesting energy

Need to compare each components depending on:
- Voltage minimal to start the device (Cold start Voltage)
- Energy required to start the device (Cold Start Ah)
- Voltage in minimal (Vin min) to work and harvest
- Number of passive components needed (reduce cost, size of PCB)
- Type of harvestor needed (Solar, Thermal, Piezo, air,..)
- Additional features, like low voltage interrupt, configuration of interrupts,..
